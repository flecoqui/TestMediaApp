# TestMediaApp: Universal Windows Platform (UWP) Media Player C# Sample Application

Overview
--------------
This Universal Windows Platform (UWP) Media Player Application can play video files, audio files and display pictures as well.
This application has been developped to test the playback of media assets on platforms running Windows 10.
Those media assets can be protected with DRM like PlayReady.
This sample application does support the following containers:<p/>
	-   **Video**: VMV, MP4, MPEG2-TS, MKV, HLS, MPEG-DASH, Smooth Streaming</p> 
	-   **Audio**: WMA, MP3, AAC, M4A, FLAC</p>
	-   **Picture**: JPG, PNG</p>

Actually the application can play all the video and audio format supported natively by Windows 10.
If the MPEG-DASH assets or the Smooth Streaming assets are protected with PlayReady, the application can play those assets. 
When the application is launched, it opens a JSON playlist which contains the list of files to play.
This JSON playlist is by default embedded within the application, the user can select another playlist to play his own content. 

This version of Universal Media Player Windows 10 application is an evolution of the [Anniversary Update (RS1) Universal Media Player Windows 10 application](https://github.com/flecoqui/Windows10/raw/master/Samples/RS1UniversalMediaPlayer/).
This version of the application introduces new features related to Windows 10 Anniversary Update:</p>
	- the support of single process background audio </p>
and new features like:</p>
	- the support of playback of content stored on a USB devices connected to your desktop or to your XBOX One.</p>
	- the support of custom http header while downloading on-line video </p>
	- the support of custom http header compliant with Azure Media Service content protection </p>

[Photos Playlist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flecoqui/Content/master/Playlists/Photos/Photos.json) </p>

### Tool to create Playlist 
A tool called AzPlaylist is available to create Playlists for TestMediaApp.</p>
With AzPlaylist you can create playlist of media files stored:</p>
  - on Azure Storage Account</p>
  - on local hard drive</p>

For instance, the command to create a playlist from media files stored on Azure:

          AzPlaylist -action create -storageaccountname <StorageAccountName> -storageaccountkey <StorageAccountKey> -containername <ContainerName> -extensions mp3;m4a;aac;flac -outputfilename <outputFileName>

For instance, the command to create a playlist from media files stored on local hard drive:

          AzPlaylist -action localcreate -folder <FolderName> -extensions mp3;m4a;aac;flac -outputfilename <outputFileName> 

Below the links associated with AzPlaylist:</p>
[AzPlaylist Source code on github](https://github.com/flecoqui/azure/tree/master/Samples/AzPlaylist) </p>
[AzPlaylist binary](https://github.com/flecoqui/azure/raw/master/Samples/AzPlaylist/Releases/LatestRelease.zip) </p>

### Companion Scenario
TestMediaApp does support companion scenario where you can convert your Windows 10 Device into a remote control.
For instance, if you want to convert your Windows 10 Mobile into a remote control, click on the Remote check box.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flecoqui/Windows10/master/Samples/TestMediaApp/Docs/remote.png)

TestMediaApp companion scenario requires a network supporting multicast. The device converted into remote control will send multicast commands towards all the Windows 10 Devices running TestMediaApp on the same network

Once your device is converted into a remote control, you can send the following commands:<p/>
	- **Previous Item**</p>
	- **Next Item**</p>
	- **Full Screen**</p>
	- **Full Window**</p>
	- **Mute**</p>
	- **Volume Up**</p>
	- **Volume Down**</p>
	- **Start over**</p>
	- **Play**</p>
	- **Pause**</p>
	- **Stop**</p>

### Getting System Information

Check SystemInformation constructor in the file SystemInformation.cs:

        static SystemInformation()
        {
            // get the system family name
            AnalyticsVersionInfo ai = AnalyticsInfo.VersionInfo;
            SystemFamily = ai.DeviceFamily;

            // get the system version number
            string sv = AnalyticsInfo.VersionInfo.DeviceFamilyVersion;
            ulong v = ulong.Parse(sv);
            ulong v1 = (v & 0xFFFF000000000000L) >> 48;
            ulong v2 = (v & 0x0000FFFF00000000L) >> 32;
            ulong v3 = (v & 0x00000000FFFF0000L) >> 16;
            ulong v4 = (v & 0x000000000000FFFFL);
            SystemVersion = $"{v1}.{v2}.{v3}.{v4}";

            // get the package architecure
            Package package = Package.Current;
            SystemArchitecture = package.Id.Architecture.ToString();

            // get the user friendly app name
            ApplicationName = package.DisplayName;

            // get the app version
            PackageVersion pv = package.Id.Version;
            ApplicationVersion = $"{pv.Major}.{pv.Minor}.{pv.Build}.{pv.Revision}";

            // get the device manufacturer and model name
            EasClientDeviceInformation eas = new EasClientDeviceInformation();
            DeviceManufacturer = eas.SystemManufacturer;
            DeviceModel = eas.SystemProductName;

            // get App Specific Hardware ID
            AppSpecificHardwareID = GetAppSpecificHardwareID();
        }

### PlayReady: Getting license expiration date 

Check method GetLicenseExpirationDate in the file MainPage.xaml.cs:

        private DateTime GetLicenseExpirationDate(Guid videoId)
        {
            
            var keyIdString = Convert.ToBase64String(videoId.ToByteArray());
            try
            {
                var contentHeader = new Windows.Media.Protection.PlayReady.PlayReadyContentHeader(
                    videoId,
                    keyIdString,
                    Windows.Media.Protection.PlayReady.PlayReadyEncryptionAlgorithm.Aes128Ctr,
                    null,
                    null,
                    string.Empty,
                    new Guid());
                Windows.Media.Protection.PlayReady.IPlayReadyLicense[] licenses = new Windows.Media.Protection.PlayReady.PlayReadyLicenseIterable(contentHeader, true).ToArray();
                foreach (var lic in licenses)
                {
                    DateTimeOffset? d = MediaHelpers.PlayReadyHelper.GetLicenseExpirationDate(lic);
                    if((d!=null)&&(d.HasValue))
                            return d.Value.DateTime;
                }
            }
            catch(Exception e)
            {
                System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("GetLicenseExpirationDate Exception: " + e.Message);
                return DateTime.MinValue;
            }
            return DateTime.MinValue;
        }


### PlayReady: Forcing Software DRM

By default the UWP App using PlayReady do support Hardware DRM if the platform does support DRM.
Unfortunately, Hardware DRM is not supported for VC-1 codec. If your UWP application needs to play a VC-1 stream protected with PlayReady the hardware DRM needs to be disable for this stream.
Moreover, the hardware DRM needs to be enabled if the content is an H.264 or H.265 stream.

Check method EnableSoftwareDRM in the file MAinPage.xaml.cs:

        bool EnableSoftwareDRM(bool bEnable)
        {
            Windows.Storage.ApplicationDataContainer localSettings = Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings;
            // Force Software DRM useful for VC1 content which doesn't support Hardware DRM
            try
            {
                if (!localSettings.Containers.ContainsKey("PlayReady"))

### Single Process Background Audio: How to keep the network alive

When the application is playing audio over http in background mode (Single Process Background Audio), the network may be not available after few minutes preventing the application from downloading the next audio file.
In order to keep the network when the application is in background mode, you need to use the MediaBinder and the Binding event.
Check method BookNetworkForBackground in the file MainPage.xaml.cs:

        Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer localMediaPlayer = null;
        Windows.Media.Core.MediaBinder localMediaBinder = null;
        Windows.Media.Core.MediaSource localMediaSource = null;
        Windows.Foundation.Deferral deferral = null;
        public bool BookNetworkForBackground()
        {
            bool result = false;
            try
            {
                if (localMediaBinder == null)
                {
                    localMediaBinder = new Windows.Media.Core.MediaBinder();
                    if (localMediaBinder != null)
                    {
                        localMediaBinder.Binding += LocalMediaBinder_Binding;
                    }
                }
                if (localMediaSource == null)
                {
                    localMediaSource = Windows.Media.Core.MediaSource.CreateFromMediaBinder(localMediaBinder);
                }
                if (localMediaPlayer == null)
                {
                    localMediaPlayer = new Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer();
                    if (localMediaPlayer != null)
                    {
                        localMediaPlayer.CommandManager.IsEnabled = false;
                        localMediaPlayer.Source = localMediaSource;
                        result = true;
                        LogMessage("Booking network for Background task successful");
                        return result;
                    }

                }
            }
            catch(Exception ex)
            {
                LogMessage("Exception while booking network for Background task: Exception: " + ex.Message);
            }
            LogMessage("Booking network for Background task failed");
            return result;
        }

Check method LocalMediaBinder_Binding in the file MainPage.xaml.cs:

        private void LocalMediaBinder_Binding(Windows.Media.Core.MediaBinder sender, Windows.Media.Core.MediaBindingEventArgs args)
        {
            deferral = args.GetDeferral();
            LogMessage("Booking network for Background task running...");
        }

### Companion scenario 

The companion scenario relies on the code in the file [CompanionClient.cs](https://github.com/flecoqui/Windows10/blob/master/Samples/TestMediaApp/cs/AudioVideoPlayer/Companion/CompanionClient.cs)
Actually this file contains the Companion implementation which use the multicast address 239.11.11.11 and the upd port 1919 to transmit the commands.
You can change the multicast address and the upd port if required.

        const string cMulticastAddress = "239.11.11.11";
        const string cPort = "1919";

Moreover, beyond the basic commands like PLAY, PAUSE, FULLSCREEN TestMediaApp supports commands like SELECT, OPENMEDIA and OPENPLAYLIST which allow the user to :</p>
	- select remotely an item in the playlist using the index associated with this item </p>
	- open remotely a media content  </p>
	- open remotely a media playlist.</p>

Strings associated with the commands below:
 
        public const string commandSelect = "SELECT";
        public const string commandOpen = "OPENMEDIA";
        public const string commandOpenPlaylist = "OPENPLAYLIST";

In that case, you need to use the [Companion Application](https://github.com/flecoqui/Windows10/tree/master/Samples/CompanionMediaPlayer).

You can select remotely an item in the playlist:

  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flecoqui/Windows10/master/Samples/TestMediaApp/Docs/selectmedia.png)

Syntax:

    INDEX=<ItemIndex>

You can play remotely media content:

  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flecoqui/Windows10/master/Samples/TestMediaApp/Docs/openmedia.png)

Syntax:

    CONTENT=<Url/Path of Media>??START=<StartTime in ms>??DURATION=<Duration in ms>??POSTERCONTENT=<Url/Path of poster>

You can open remotely a playlist:

  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flecoqui/Windows10/master/Samples/TestMediaApp/Docs/openplaylist.png)

Syntax:

     CONTENT=<Url/Path of Playlist>


Building the application
----------------

**Prerequisite: Windows Smooth Streaming Client SDK**
This version is based on the latest [Universal Smooth Streaming Client SDK](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/1e7d4700-7fa8-49b6-8a7b-8d8666685459)

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Ensure the Creator Update (RS2) Windows 10 SDK is installed on your machine
3. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio 2015 Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.


**Deploying and running the sample**
1.  To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Debugging**. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Without Debugging**.



Next steps
--------------

The Universal Media Player C# Sample Applicaton could be improved to support the following features:</p>
1.  Support of Project Rome to launch remotely TestMediaApp from one device to another device</p>
2.  Support of several pages : Player Page, Companion Page, Playlist Page and Settings Page.</p>
3.  Support of a new JSON model to support music playlist (Artist, Album), TV channels  </p>
